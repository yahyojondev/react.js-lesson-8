 If you have a small business, SMS is one of the best ways to keep in contact with your customers. For things like order confirmations, booking reminders, special offers, and updates, texts work better than emailâ€”because people actually read them.

Of course, you can't just grab your smartphone and start sending messages; you run a business. SMS marketing apps let you message customers directly, or automate the whole process, so they get sent a text based on your booking calendar, marketing list, or other integrated app. Best of all, your customers can even text you straight back.

I've been covering technology for more than 10 years, and I've been responsible for updating this list for the past six years, with a little help from other Zapier app testers. In that time, I've deeply researched and tested several dozen of the top SMS apps for small businesses. Based on all those experiences, here are my picks for the best SMS marketing tools.
